=head1 NAME

App::TimeTracker::Command::Overtime - Tells you if you have already worked enough

=head1 VERSION

version 2.010

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin allows you to define the time you plan to work on your projects, and compare the time you actually worked with those targets.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

=head2 plugins

Add C<Overtime> to the list of plugins.

=head2 other setup

You have to add a file called F<target.json> to the directories containing the monthly tracking files (eg F<~/.TimeTracker/2011/10/target.json>). This files has to contain a JSON hash consisting of the project names as keys and the planned time (in hours) as values:

  {
    "some_project":"20",
    "other_project":"35"
  }

Currently, C<Overtime> only supports per-month targets.

=head1 NEW COMMANDS

=head2 overtime

  ~/work/some_project$ tracker overtime --this month
  Project        | Worked   | Target | Status
  ---------------+----------+--------+------------------------------
  some_project   | 21:12:12 | 20     | You missed your target by 01:12:12
  other_project  | 33:39:26 | 35     | Keep working 01:20:34 missing

=head2 Options

Same as report, even though currently only C<--this month> will work.

=head1 CHANGES TO OTHER COMMANDS

none.
